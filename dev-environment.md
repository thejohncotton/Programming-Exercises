# Setting up your development environment
An intentionally vague exercise in creating a new front-end dev environment from scratch using the CLI, a text editor, and github/netlify to deploy a site.

This exercise reviews:
  1. Basic shell commands
  2. Basic text editor skills
  3. Basic git skills


## Start by opening up your CLI

1. Navigate to the directory that contains your websites and make a new directory with the name of your website i.e. ‘new-site-boilerplate’ and inside the directory:
  - Create an index.html file.
  - Make a new directory for css, and inside make a style.css file.
  - Make a js directory, and inside make a script.js file.
  - Make a img directory that will contain your images.



## Now open up your favorite text editor

1. add some quick html boilerplate '! + tab'
2. link to your stylesheet style.css
3. link to your scripts script.js
4. link to external styles and scripts (resets, jquery, bootstrap)
5. Add a title to your page head.
6. Add an H1 with the text "Welcome, check your console."
7. Add some style to your h1
8. in script.js add a console.log statement with the argument of "Hello, World"
9. test the page in your browser.


### * What good is a site if it only exists on your computer!? *
## Getting started with git:
#### Back to the good old CLI

1. initialize a new git repository
2. stage your changes using add
3. commit your changes

### In your browser
1. create a new [github](https://github.com) repository
2. copy the repository address that ends in .git


### CLI
1. add your github repo as a new remote called origin
2. push your changes to github

### Browser
1. head to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. create a new site from your github repository
3. deploy!
4. configure the site with a custom URL
5. (optional) BUY the domain using [Google Domains](domains.google.com) and configure netlify to use your custom domain.
